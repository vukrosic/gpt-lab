# GPT-Lab **(currently in ALPHA)**
this repo is a massive overhaul of [Modded-NanoGPT](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt) with the goal of being a base for amateurs to do cheap & easy LLM experiments at a large enough scale to be worthy of an arxiv preprint. the idea is that repos like Modded-NanoGPT, [NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama), and [Meta's Lingua](https://github.com/facebookresearch/lingua), are either too old of an architecture, too purpose-specific, not from-scratch enough, too expensive to run, too overly-complicated, not well setup for quickly iterating research ideas, etc and we plan to occupy a unique balance of those trade-offs

**this repo is currently in alpha, meaning that I think it's somewhat workable but have not utilized it on enough of my own experiments to guarantee that. before taking it out of alpha I will:**
    
1. implement the further improvements defined in the todo section below and 
2. go and implement a few experiment ideas and use what I learn from the difficulties I run into to add more things to the todo list

check out the video I made about it:

## getting started
the input arguments in these instructions are comically small values designed to get you up and running on the tiniest GPU(s) for demonstration purposes; in practice you'll have to tune them to properly utilize the available VRAM of your setup

1. either have one or more GPUs or hook up to a cloud GPU. for the latter see [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/mmRlZKFLAvE); i recommend [vast.ai](vast.ai) since they're always at or near the cheapest
2. either fork or create a template of this repo
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. train your tokenizer on fineweb. samples is the number of text characters to train on (split up evenly across all GPUs). vocabulary size should exclude any special tokens you plan on using later. for a tutorial on how Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers work, see [andrej karpathy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=1430s) for a simple & slow CPU implementation

single GPU:
```
python train_tokenizer.py --samples 100000 --vocabsize 1000 --name readmetokenizer --demo
```
multiple GPUs (replace `G` with the number of GPUs you have):
```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=G train_tokenizer.py --samples 100000 --vocabsize 1000 --name readmetokenizer --demo
```
5. download the [fineweb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) dataset and convert all the raw text into tokens. dataset options are 10B, 100B, 10Bedu (default), or 100Bedu. tune shard_size (default 100 million) and num_shards to the quantity of data for your desired training run length. the script will only create one shard for the validation set which is not included in the count of num_shards
```
python download_fineweb.py --version 10B --shard_size 10000000 --num_shards 1 --tokenizer readmetokenizer_v1000_n100000.pkl
```
6. download the hellaswag benchmark: `python download_hellaswag.py`
7. train your language model. vocabulary size must be equial to your tokenizer size PLUS any special tokens defined in this script (1 for '<|endoftext|>', so 1000 + 1 = 10001). **WARNING:** if you include `--save_model` that will create a `.pt` file of the model weights, but by default the `.gitignore` will now allow this file to be pushed to github with the rest of the repo. this is done because the filesize is too large for github, and it means you have to find a way to download the model weights manually if you're on a cloud GPU and want to keep them

single GPU:
```
python train_gpt.py --model_name ReadmeGPT --tokenizer readmetokenizer_v1000_n100000.pkl --vocab_size 1001 --model_dim 128 --num_heads 4 --num_layers 6
```
multiple GPUs (replace `G`):
```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=G train_gpt.py --model_name ReadmeGPT --tokenizer readmetokenizer_v1000_n100000.pkl --vocab_size 1001 --model_dim 128 --num_heads 4 --num_layers 6
```
8. look in `experiments/` for your model. you should see 1) a `.txt` backup of all the `.py` files we just ran at the time of training (except `train_tokenizer.py`, which is backed inside the tokenizer `.pkl` file and therefore not readable from a file browser), 2) a `.csv` containing the training time & loss, 3) a log file containing important information such as the hellaswag benchmark score and the maximum memory allocated during training, and 4) maybe a `.pt` file if you elected to run with `--save_model`
9. great, now that all that is confirmed to be up & working you can start editing the code and running your own experiments!

- [ ] train models on 1x8GB vram, 2x16 GB, 4x32GB, and 8x80GB (for how much data each??) and record how much $ each one cost to run so that people have an estimate before doing their experiments
    - [ ] use chinchilla-optimal model size & data quantity?

# Modded-NanoGPT (ORIGINAL README)

This repository hosts the *NanoGPT speedrun*, in which we (collaboratively|competitively) search for the fastest algorithm to use 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs to train a language model that attains 3.28 cross-entropy loss on the [FineWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) validation set.

The target (3.28 validation loss on FineWeb) follows Andrej Karpathy's [GPT-2 replication in llm.c, which attains that loss after running for 45 minutes](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%20the%20optimization%20we%27ll%20get%20to%20about%203.29).
The speedrun code also descends from llm.c's [PyTorch trainer](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/blob/master/train_gpt2.py), which itself descends from NanoGPT, hence the name of the repo.
Thanks to the efforts of many contributors, this repo now contains a training algorithm which attains the target performance in:
* 3 minutes on 8xH100 (the llm.c GPT-2 replication needed 45)
* 0.73B tokens (the llm.c GPT-2 replication needed 10B)

This improvement in training speed has been brought about by the following techniques:
* Modernized architecture: Rotary embeddings, QK-Norm, and ReLU²
* The Muon optimizer [[writeup](https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/)] [[repo](https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon)]
* Untie head from embedding, use FP8 matmul for head, and softcap logits (the latter following Gemma 2)
* Initialization of projection and classification layers to zero (muP-like)
* Skip connections from embedding to every block as well as between blocks in U-net pattern
* Extra embeddings which are mixed into the values in attention layers (inspired by Zhou et al. 2024)
* FlexAttention with long-short sliding window attention pattern (inspired by Gemma 2) and window size warmup

## Running the current record

To run the current record, run the following commands.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt.git && cd modded-nanogpt
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --pre torch==2.7.0.dev20250110+cu126 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu126 --upgrade
python data/cached_fineweb10B.py 8 # downloads only the first 800M training tokens to save time
./run.sh
```

**Note: torch.compile will take around 5 minutes the first time you run the code.**

## Alternative: Running with Docker (recommended for timing)

For cases where CUDA or NCCL versions aren't compatible with your current system setup, Docker can be a helpful alternative.
This approach standardizes versions for CUDA, NCCL, CUDNN, and Python, reducing dependency issues and simplifying setup. 
Note: an NVIDIA driver must already be installed on the system (useful if only the NVIDIA driver and Docker are available).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt.git && cd modded-nanogpt
sudo docker build -t modded-nanogpt .
sudo docker run -it --rm --gpus all -v $(pwd):/modded-nanogpt modded-nanogpt python data/cached_fineweb10B.py 8
sudo docker run -it --rm --gpus all -v $(pwd):/modded-nanogpt modded-nanogpt sh run.sh
```

To get an interactive docker, you can use
```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm --gpus all -v $(pwd):/modded-nanogpt modded-nanogpt bash
```

## Rules

The only rules are that new records must:

1. Not modify the train or validation data pipelines. (You can change the batch size, sequence length, attention structure etc.; just don't change the underlying streams of tokens.)
3. Attain ≤3.28 mean val loss. (Due to inter-run variance, submissions must provide enough run logs to attain a statistical significance level of p<0.01 that their mean val loss is ≤3.28. Example code to compute p-value can be found [here](records/010425_SoftCap#softer-softcap).)
2. Not use any extra `torch._inductor.config` or `torch.compile` flags. (These can save a few seconds, but they can also make compilation take >30min. This rule was introduced after the 21st record.)

Other than that, anything and everything is fair game!

### Comment on the target metric

The target metric is *cross-entropy loss on the FineWeb val set*. To speak mathematically, the goal of the speedrun is *to obtain a probability model of language which assigns a probability of at least `math.exp(-3.28 * 10485760)` to the first 10,485,760 tokens of the FineWeb valset. Hence, e.g., we allow evaluation at any sequence length, so long as we still have a valid probability model of language.

---

### Timing change after record 21

After the 21st record, we made two changes to the timing. First, there used to be an initial "grace period" of 10 untimed steps to allow kernel warmup. We replaced this with an explicit kernel-warmup section which is untimed and uses dummy data. This results in an extra runtime of 850ms from the 10 extra timed steps.
Second, we banned the use of `torch._inductor.config.coordinate_descent_tuning`. This saves ~25min of untimed pre-run compilation, but results in an extra runtime of ~3s.

<!--Note: The original llm.c baseline is intended to be closer to a replication of GPT-2 than to an optimized LLM training.
So it's no surprise that there is room to improve; as @karpathy has said, 'llm.c still has a lot of pending optimizations.'
In addition, many of the techniques used in these records are completely standard, such as rotary embeddings.
The goal of this benchmark/speedrun is simply to find out which techniques actually work, and maybe come up with some new ones.-->
<!--The goal of this benchmark is simply to find out all the techniques which actually work, because I'm going crazy reading all these
LLM training papers
which claim a huge benefit but then use their own idiosyncratic non-competitive benchmark and therefore no one in the community has any idea if it's legit for months.-->
<!--[LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14342) [training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01131)-->
<!--I mean hello??? We're in a completely empirical field; it is insane to not have a benchmark. Ideally everyone uses the same LLM training benchmark,
and then reviewing LLM training papers becomes as simple as checking if they beat the benchmark. It's not like this would be unprecedented, that's how things
were in the ImageNet days.
The only possible 'benefit' I can think of for any empirical field to abandon benchmarks is that it would make it easier to publish false results. Oh, I guess that's why it happened.
Hilarious to think about how, in the often-commented-upon and ongoing collapse of the peer review system, people blame the *reviewers* --
yeah, those guys doing free labor who everyone constantly musters all of their intelligence to lie to, it's *their* fault! My bad, you caught me monologuing.-->

### Notable attempts & forks

**Notable runs:**

* [@alexjc's 01/20/2025 2.77-minute TokenMonster-based record](https://x.com/alexjc/status/1881410039639863622).
This record is technically outside the rules of the speedrun, since we specified that the train/val tokens must be kept fixed.
However, it's very interesting, and worth including. The run is not more data-efficient; rather, the speedup comes from the improved tokenizer allowing
the vocabulary size to be reduced (nearly halved!) while preserving the same bytes-per-token, which saves lots of parameters and FLOPs in the head and embeddings.

## Speedrun track 2: GPT-2 Medium

The target loss for this track is lowered from 3.28 to 2.92, as per Andrej Karpathy's 350M-parameter llm.c baseline.
This baseline generates a model with performance similar to the original GPT-2 Medium, whereas the first track's baseline generates a model on par with GPT-2 Small.
All other rules remain the same.

### Q: What is the point of NanoGPT speedrunning?

A: The officially stated goal of NanoGPT speedrunning is as follows: `gotta go fast`. But for something a little more verbose involving an argument for good benchmarking, here's some kind of manifesto, adorned with a blessing from the master. [https://x.com/karpathy/status/1846790537262571739](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1846790537262571739)

### Q: What makes "NanoGPT speedrunning" not just another idiosyncratic benchmark?

A: Because it is a *competitive* benchmark. In particular, if you attain a new speed record (using whatever method you want), there is an open invitation for you
to post that record (on arXiv or X) and thereby vacuum up all the clout for yourself. I will even help you do it by reposting you as much as I can.

<!--On the contrary, for example, the benchmark used in the [Sophia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14342) paper does *not* have this property.
There is no such open invitation for anyone to compete on the benchmark they used. In particular, if, for a random and definitely not weirdly specific example, you happen to find better AdamW hyperparameters for their training setup than
the ones they used which significantly close the gap between AdamW and their proposed optimizer,
then there is no clear path for you to publish that result in *any* form.
You could try posting it on X.com, but then you would be risking being perceived as aggressive/confrontational, which is *not a good look* in this racket.
So if you're rational, the result probably just dies with you and no one else learns anything
(unless you're in a frontier lab, in which case you can do a nice internal writeup. Boy I'd love to get my hands on those writeups).-->

### Q: NanoGPT speedrunning is cool and all, but meh it probably won't scale and is just overfitting to val loss

A: This is hard to refute, since "at scale" is an infinite category (what if the methods stop working only for >100T models?), making it impossible to fully prove.
Also, I would agree that some of the methods used in the speedrun are unlikely to scale, particularly those which *impose additional structure* on the network, such as logit softcapping.
But if the reader cares about 1.5B models, they might be convinced by this result:

*Straightforwardly scaling up the speedrun (10/18/24 version) to 1.5B parameters yields a model with GPT-2 (1.5B)-level HellaSwag performance 2.5x more cheaply than [@karpathy's baseline](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/677) ($233 instead of $576):*

## [Muon optimizer](https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon)

Muon is defined as follows:

![](img/algo_optimizer.png)

Where NewtonSchulz5 is the following Newton-Schulz iteration [2, 3], which approximately replaces `G` with `U @ V.T` where `U, S, V = G.svd()`.
```python
@torch.compile
def zeroth_power_via_newtonschulz5(G, steps=5, eps=1e-7):
    assert len(G.shape) == 2
    a, b, c = (3.4445, -4.7750,  2.0315)
    X = G.bfloat16() / (G.norm() + eps)
    if G.size(0) > G.size(1):
        X = X.T 
    for _ in range(steps):
        A = X @ X.T
        B = b * A + c * A @ A
        X = a * X + B @ X
    if G.size(0) > G.size(1):
        X = X.T 
    return X.to(G.dtype)
```

For this training scenario, Muon has the following favorable properties:
* Lower memory usage than Adam
* ~1.5x better sample-efficiency
* <2% wallclock overhead


### Provenance

Many of the choices made to generate this optimizer were obtained experimentally by our pursuit of [CIFAR-10 speedrunning](https://github.com/KellerJordan/cifar10-airbench).
In particular, we experimentally obtained the following practices:
* Using Nesterov momentum inside the update, with orthogonalization applied after momentum.
* Using a specifically quintic Newton-Schulz iteration as the method of orthogonalization.
* Using non-convergent coefficients for the quintic polynomial in order to maximize slope at zero, and thereby minimize the number of necessary Newton-Schulz iterations.
It turns out that the variance doesn't actually matter that much, so we end up with a quintic that rapidly converges to the range 0.68, 1.13 upon repeated application, rather than converging more slowly to 1.
* Running the Newton-Schulz iteration in bfloat16 (whereas Shampoo implementations often depend on inverse-pth-roots run in fp32 or fp64).

Our use of a Newton-Schulz iteration for orthogonalization traces to [Bernstein & Newhouse (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20325),
who suggested it as a way to compute Shampoo [5, 6] preconditioners, and theoretically explored Shampoo without preconditioner accumulation.
In particular, Jeremy Bernstein @jxbz sent us the draft, which caused us to experiment with various Newton-Schulz iterations as the
orthogonalization method for this optimizer.
If we had used SVD instead of a Newton-Schulz iteration, this optimizer would have been too slow to be useful.
Bernstein & Newhouse also pointed out that Shampoo without preconditioner accumulation is equivalent to steepest descent in the spectral norm,
and therefore Shampoo can be thought of as a way to smooth out spectral steepest descent.
The proposed optimizer can be thought of as a second way of smoothing spectral steepest descent, with a different set of memory and runtime tradeoffs
compared to Shampoo.

## Running on fewer GPUs

* To run experiments on fewer GPUs, simply modify `run.sh` to have a different `--nproc_per_node`. This should not change the behavior of the training.
* If you're running out of memory, you may need to reduce the sequence length for FlexAttention (which does change the training. see [here](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt/pull/38) for a guide)
